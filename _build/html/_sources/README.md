# Computational Science and Engineering
My notes on [MITOCW 18.085](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-085-computational-science-and-engineering-i-fall-2008/) taught by Prof. Gil Strang. 

Computational Sciences consists of 3 things:
- **Applied Linear Algebra:** Matrices come to life here!
    - **Four Special Matrices**: Lecture 1 covers $K$, $T$, $C$ and $B$ matrices.
    - **Differential and Difference Equations**: Lecture 2 discusses Poisson Equation thoroughly.
- **ODEs and PDEs:** Numerical Methods
- **Fourier:** Discrete Fourier Transform is key here!
