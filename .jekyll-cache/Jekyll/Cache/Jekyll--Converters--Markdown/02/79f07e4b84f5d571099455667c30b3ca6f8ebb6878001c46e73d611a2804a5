<p>Consider a scenario where a <em>thin, insulated</em> metal rod is put on an <em>infinite block of ice at both ends</em> and a <em>blowtorch</em> is heating it along itâ€™s length (see Figure 1). The task is to find the temperature at several locations along the bar when it reaches steady state (i.e. when thereâ€™s no change in temperature of the rod with time).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the above description, we actually received almost all the assumptions for the problem:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Thin</em>: Itâ€™s just a 1D problem with probably \(x\) used to denote the location along the length of the rod.</li>
    <li><em>Insulated</em>: No energy loss due to radiation from the surface of the rod to the surroundings.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>Partial Differential Equation</em> (PDE) with boundary conditions explaining this scenario is known as the <strong>Heat Equation</strong> (Steady-State in this case).</p>

\[-\frac{d^2u}{dx^2}=f(x) \ \ \forall \ 0 \le x \le 1; \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ u(0)=u(1)=0 \tag{1}\]

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The temperature distribution along the length of the rod which ranges between 0 and 1 is given as \(u(x)\),</li>
    <li>The source term (<em>blowtorch</em>) is defined as \(f(x)\) and,</li>
    <li>The boundary conditions \(u(x)=u(1)=0\) represent the <em>ice block</em> at the ends.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The complete Heat Equation is derived using conservation of heat energy and Fourierâ€™s Law of Heat Conduction, details to which can be found in my <a href="">YouTube Video</a> or the <a href="">Blog Post</a> on this topic.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-boundary-conditions-so-important">Why are <em>Boundary Conditions</em> so important?</h3>
<p>For the time being, set \(f(x)=1\). Now looking at the differential equation, what we need is some function \(u(x)\) that satisfies \(-\frac{d^2u}{dx^2}=1\). For this simple problem, we can integrate both sides twice and get a solution \(u(x)=-\frac{1}{2}x^2 + Cx + D\) where \(C\) and \(D\) can be any constants! This is where boundary conditions \(u(0)=u(1)=0\) fix the values of \(C\), \(D\) and gives us a unique solution \(u(x)=-\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x\).</p>

<h3 id="finite-differences">Finite Differences</h3>
<p>In order to solve the PDE on a computer, we need to find a way to represent or approximate the derivatives numerically, which is done using Finite Differences. From <em>Taylor Series</em>, we know that</p>

\[u(x+h) = u(x) + h u'(x) + \frac{h^2}{2!}u''(x) + \frac{h^3}{3!}u'''(x) + \cdots \tag{2}\]

<p>and</p>

\[u(x-h) = u(x) - h u'(x) + \frac{h^2}{2!}u''(x) - \frac{h^3}{3!}u'''(x) + \cdots \tag{3}\]

<p>Rearranging Equation \((2)\), we can get the <em>Forward Difference Approximation</em> to the 1st order derivative</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{u(x+h) -  u(x)}{h} &amp; = u'(x) + \frac{h}{2!}u''(x) + \frac{h^2}{3!}u'''(x) + \cdots \\
                        &amp; = u'(x) + \mathcal{O}(h) 
\end{aligned} \tag{4}\]

<p>Similarly from Equation \((3)\), we can get the <em>Backward Difference Approximation</em> to the 1st order derivative</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{u(x) -  u(x-h)}{h} &amp; = u'(x) - \frac{h}{2!}u''(x) + \frac{h^2}{3!}u'''(x) + \cdots \\
                        &amp; = u'(x) + \mathcal{O}(h) 
\end{aligned} \tag{5}\]

<p>Finally, subtracting Equation \((3)\) from Equation \((2)\), we can get the <em>Centered Difference Approximation</em> to the 1st order derivative</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{u(x+h) -  u(x-h)}{2h} &amp; = u'(x) + \frac{2h^2}{3!}u'''(x) + \cdots \\
                        &amp; = u'(x) + \mathcal{O}(h^2) 
\end{aligned} \tag{6}\]

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Centered Difference</em> is 2nd order Accurate in \(h\) while others are 1st order Accurate in \(h\)!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can also add Equations \((2)\) and \((3)\), to get an approximation to 2nd order derivative</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{u(x+h) - 2u(x) +  u(x-h)}{h^2} &amp; = u''(x) + \frac{2h^2}{4!}u''''(x) + \cdots \\
                        &amp; = u''(x) + \mathcal{O}(h^2) 
\end{aligned} \tag{7}\]

<blockquote>
  <p>2nd order derivative is by default 2nd order accurate in \(h\)!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next step is to use the above defined equations \((2)\) through \((7)\) and convert the <em>Differential Equation</em> to a <em>Difference Equation</em>. For this, we need <strong>numerical descretisation</strong>.</p>
